Drømmeland," Jeg sætter mig på kanten af din seng, og du ler til mig. Verden svinder ind til ingenting, når jeg ser på dig. Du ligger lige så musestille, og virker ubeskriveligt lille imellem dine mange sjove dyr. Men i drømmelegen finder vi to vejen ud mod nye eventyr. Under stjernerne på himlen sejler du med mig. Luk nu stille dine øjne, så er vi på vej. Vi sejler over vandet og ind i drømmelandet, du og jeg. Og hvis du bliver skræmt af vinden, så kysser jeg dig blidt på kinden. Hvor du end er i fantasien, vil jeg altid være her hos dig, min kære. Læg nu trygt din hånd i min. Under stjernerne på himlen, sejler du med mig. Luk nu stille dine øjne, så er vi på vej. Vi sejler over vandet og ind i drømmelandet, du og jeg. Drømmelandet, du og jeg ",1938

Tempo Ruim," Eu sou o Deus da Guerra, no meu peito rufam tambores Tocados em ritos, criados sobre o grito de dores Angústia do porão, desejo de vingança, solidão Piedade, hoje não, talvez quando eu tinha um coração A meta: Construir outros quinhentos E tô disposto a morrer, igual cada um dos trezentos Espartanos, o que vocês são? (Ahu!) Mudo e mando: Manos, o que vocês são? (A Rua!) Nosso alimento é o medo no olhar do oponente Tombando em frente, sentindo o que há tempos a gente sente Logo beijem suas mulheres, beijem pra eternizar Devemos considerar a possibilidade de não voltar E não cobrar a diáspora Vim matar meus inimigos igual Sun Tzu, e isso não é uma metáfora Os meus reconheço pela conduta Prepare os seus, hoje verá que um filho teu não foge a luta Adeus Adeus (Seja como Deus quiser) Meu amor, não esqueça de mim (Não, não) Vou rezar pra ter bom tempo, meu nego Pra não ter tempo ruim Me botaram tão pra baixo aqui Que do ponto onde cheguei, só era possível subir Guardei toda mágoa, pra com ela regar meu rancor Alimentar minha raiva, devolver em forma de dor Magrelo da perna comprida, com ódio pra mais de uma vida No campão visto como besta Na mente o diabo fazendo hora extra, hey! Quem já viu o que vi, não faz questão de replay A lei dos canalha fez a vida cheia de falha Por isso minha existência (hoje) só tem sentido na batalha Onde o normal é não ter pai, esperar a mãe que não vem Sentir frio, fome, não ter o que todo mundo tem Ter vergonha do espelho, aliás, se espelhar em quem? Pular uns corpos do caminho, achando que isso é normal também O que resta? Lutar pra se sentir vivo Hoje MC's querem festas, eu ainda quero motivos Adeus Adeus (Seja como Deus quiser) Meu amor, não esqueça de mim (Não, não) Vou rezar pra ter bom tempo, meu nego Pra não ter tempo ruim Avisem que Zumbi voltou, tá ligado, a hora do ""Bum"" Cês vão lembrar que o punho cerrado é mais que o logo da Slum Nego Nagô, trago nos olhos Xangô e Ogum Caem fracos, não se carrega peso morto, essa é a regra um Via massacre todo dia Ganhei que se inocência fosse segurança, criança não morria Minha esperança morreu cedo, e ao invés de sentir medo da matança O resto de mim jurou vingança Uno os maloqueiros, pra honrar os em memória Uns dizem que faz dinheiro, (será?), a gente faz história Eles são porcos num chiqueiro de inglória Irmão, cê não acha que se explica demais pra quem tem razão? Há anos manos traficam no quintal Se coxinhas não vêem sua parte causa um funeral Pretos amontoados por um racismo brutal Não tem justiça, quero vingança, foda-se, agora é pessoal!

In her fairy-tale world she's a lost soul singing in a sad voice nobody hears. She waits in her castle of make-believing for her white knight to appear. Pusy Willow --- down fur-lined avenue brushing the sleep from her young woman eyes. Runs for the train --- see, eight o'clock's coming cutting dreams down to size again. Pussy Willow --- down fur-lined avenue brushing the sleep from her young woman eyes. Runs from the train. Hear her typewriter humming cutting dreams down to size again. She longs for the East and a pale dress flowing an apartment in old Mayfair. Or to fish the Spey, spinning the first run of Spring or to die for a cause somewhere.

Sempre!," Dopo un giorno cosi come e dolce la sera stare qui con te questa notte verra come un pegno d'amore dopo tanta aridita la tua acqua bagnera la riva mia si plachera ti cercavo da sempre, sempre, sempre, sempre sempre sognavo i tuoi sapori camminando fianco i muri e adesso che mi stai vicina piu che mai o sforio piano al buio il rosa caldo del mondo tuo Mi dimentico gli inverni che ti trovi nei ritorni sempre, sempre, sempre, sempre, sempre e forse piu importante il domani del presente sempre, sempre, sempre, sempre, sempre e una parola sola...c'e tutto quella che vorrei viviamo in velocita consumando di fretta tutto quanto ma questo istante vedrai non potra mai finere tanta gente intorno a me ed ognuno pensa a se Tu dove sei? Mi manchi sai.

After a day like this how sweet the evening is to stay here with you. Tonight will come like a pledge of love. After much drought your water will wash over me, my river...it will hit me. I have looked for you always, always, always, always, always. I dreamt about your essence walking along the walls, and now that you are close to me, closer than ever, I touch softly in the dark the rosy heat of your world. I forget about the cold winters when you return to me. Always, always, always, always, always. It is perhaps more important tomorrow than the present. Always, always, always, always, always is only a word...it has everything I would like. We live in speed, everything consumed in a hurry, but this moment you will see, can never end. Many people are around me and they all think of themselves. And where are you? You know that I miss you always, always, always, always, always. Life goes on and this nothing will be greater when we are together always, always, always, always, always. In my word there is only one promise and I will give it to you every moment because you are greater than my heart. Open and watchfull I will be always, always, always, always, always. And perhaps it is more important tomorrow than the present. Always, always, always, always, always. It is only a word but a bet, you know, it will always be like this. So sweet the evening to stay here with you and night will come like a pledge of love. ",1943
