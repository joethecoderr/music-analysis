Alice's Restaurant Massacree," This song is called Alice's Restaurant, and it's about Alice, and the restaurant. But Alice's Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant, that's just the name of the song, and that's why I called the song, Alice's Restaurant. You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track An' you can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant Now it all started two Thanksgivings ago, was on - two years ago on Thanksgiving, when my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the restaurant, but Alice doesn't live in the restaurant, she lives in the church nearby the restaurant, in the bell-tower, with her husband Ray and Fasha the dog. And livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs where the pews used to be. An' havin' all that room, seein' as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time. We got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump. So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW microbus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the city dump. Well, we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the dump saying, ""Closed on Thanksgiving."" And we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off into the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage. We didn't find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the side road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the cliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile is better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down. That's what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, went to sleep and didn't get up until the next morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie. He said, ""Kid, we found your name on an envelope at the bottom of ab' a half a ton of garbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it."" And I said, ""Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope under that garbage."" After speaking to Obie for about fourty-five minutes on the telephone we finally arrived at the truth of the matter and said, that we had to go down and pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the police officer's station. So we got in the red VW microbus with the shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the police officer's station. Now friends, there was only one or two things that Obie coulda done at the police station, and the first was he coulda given us a medal for being so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn't very likely, and we didn't expect it, and the other thing was he coulda bawled us out and told us never to be see driving garbage around the vicinity again, which is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer's station there was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon, and we was both immediately arrested. Handcuffed. And I said ""Obie, I don't think I can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on."" He said, ""Shut up, kid. Get in the back of the patrol car."" And that's what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the quote Scene of the Crime unquote. I want tell you about the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this happened here, they got three stop signs, two police officers, and one police car, but when we got to the Scene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars, being the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it. And they was using up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hangin' around the police officer's station. They was taking plaster tire tracks, foot prints, dog smelling prints, and they took twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy photographs with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us. Took pictures of the approach, the getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that's not to mention the aerial photography. After the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was going to put us in the cell. Said, ""Kid, I'm going to put you in the cell, I want your wallet and your belt."" And I said, ""Obie, I can understand you wanting my wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?"" And he said, ""Kid, we don't want any hangings."" I said, ""Obie, did you think I was going to hang myself for litterin'?"" Obie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head and drown, and he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars roll out the - roll the toilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an escape. Obie was making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that Alice... Remember Alice? It's a song about Alice... Alice came by and with a few nasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail, and we went back to the church, had a another thanksgiving dinner that couldn't be beat, and didn't get up until the next morning, when we all had to go to court. We walked in, sat down, Obie came in with the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, sat down. Man came in said, ""All rise."" We all stood up, and Obie stood up with the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures, and the judge walked in sat down with a seeing eye dog, and he sat down, we sat down. Obie looked at the seeing eye dog, and then at the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one, and looked at the seeing eye dog. And then at twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry, 'cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American blind justice, and there wasn't nothing he could do about it, and the judge wasn't going to look at the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us. And we was fined fifty dollars and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but that's not what I came to tell you about. Came to talk about the draft. They got a building down in New York City, it's called Whitehall Street, where you walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected, neglected and selected. I went down to get my physical examination one day, and I walked in, I sat down, got good and drunk the night before, so I looked and felt my best when I went in that morning. 'Cause I wanted to look like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted to feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York, and I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all kinds o' mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave me a piece of paper, said, ""Kid, see the psychiatrist, room 604."" And I went up there, I said, ""Shrink, I want to kill. I mean, I wanna, I wanna kill. Kill. I wanna, I wanna see, I wanna see blood and gore and guts and veins in my teeth. Eat dead burnt bodies. I mean kill, kill, kill, kill."" And I started jumpin' up and down yelling, ""Kill! Kill!"" and he started jumpin' up and down with me and we was both jumping up and down yelling, ""Kill! Kill!"" And the Sargent came over, pinned a medal on me, sent me down the hall, said, ""You're our boy."" Didn't feel too good about it. An' I proceeded on down the hall gettin' more injections, inspections, detections, neglections and all kinds of stuff that they as doin' to me at the thing there, and I was there for two hours, three hours, four hours, I was there for a long time going through all kinds of mean nasty ugly things and I was just having a tough time there, and they was inspecting, injecting every single part of me, and they was leaving no part untouched. Proceeded through, and when I finally came to the see the last man, I walked in, walked in sat down after a whole big thing there, and I walked up and said, ""What do you want?"" He said, ""Kid, we only got one question. Have you ever been arrested?"" And I proceeded to tell him the story of the Alice's Restaurant Massacre, with full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and all the phenome... - and he stopped me right there and said, ""Kid, did you ever go to court?"" And I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight-by-ten color glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and the paragraph on the back of each one, and he stopped me right there and said, ""Kid, I want you to go and sit down on that bench that says Group W, now kid!"" And I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is, Group W's where they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after committin' your special crime, and there was all kinds of mean nasty ugly looking people on the bench there. Mother rapers. Father stabbers. Father rapers! Father rapers sitting right there on the bench next to me! And they was mean and nasty and ugly and horrible crime-type guys sitting on the bench next to me. And the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one, the meanest father raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean 'n' ugly 'n' nasty 'n' horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me and said, ""Kid, whad'ya get?"" I said, ""I didn't get nothing, I had to pay $50 and pick up the garbage."" He said, ""What were you arrested for, kid?"" And I said, ""Litterin'."" And they all moved away from me on the bench there, and the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I said, ""And creating a nuisance."" And they all came back, shook my hand, and we had a great time on the bench, talkin' about crime, mother stabbing, father raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the bench. And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of things, until the Sargent came over, had some paper in his hand, held it up and said. ""Kids, this-piece-of-paper's-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-know-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-officer's-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say"", and talked for forty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said, but we had fun filling out the forms and playing with the pencils on the bench there, and I filled out the massacre with the four part harmony, and wrote it down there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the pencil, and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the other side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on the other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read the following words: (""Kid, have you rehabilitated yourself?"") I went over to the Sargent, said, ""Sargent, you got a lot a damn gall to ask me if I've rehabilitated myself, I mean, I mean, I mean that just, I'm sittin' here on the bench, I mean I'm sittin' here on the Group W bench, 'cause you want to know if I'm moral enough join the army, burn women, kids, houses and villages after bein' a litterbug."" He looked at me and said, ""Kid, we don't like your kind, and we're gonna send you fingerprints off to Washington."" And friends, somewhere in Washington enshrined in some little folder, is a study in black and white of my fingerprints. And the only reason I'm singing you this song now is cause you may know somebody in a similar situation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if your in a situation like that there's only one thing you can do and that's walk into the shrink wherever you are, just walk in say ""Shrink, You can get anything you want, at Alice's restaurant."" And walk out. You know, if one person, just one person does it they may think he's really sick and they won't take him. And if two people, two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both faggots and they won't take either of them. And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in singin' a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. They may think it's an organization. And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day, I said fifty people a day walking in singin' a bar of Alice's Restaurant and walking out. And friends they may thinks it's a movement. And that's what it is, the Alice's Restaurant Anti-Massacree Movement, and all you got to do to join is sing it the next time it come's around on the guitar. With feeling. So we'll wait for it to come around on the guitar, here and sing it when it does. Here it comes. You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant That was horrible. If you want to end war and stuff you got to sing loud. I've been singing this song now for twenty five minutes. I could sing it for another twenty five minutes. I'm not proud... or tired. So we'll wait till it comes around again, and this time with four part harmony and feeling. We're just waitin' for it to come around is what we're doing. All right now. You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant (Excepting Alice) You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant (I said) Walk right in it's around the back, just a half a mile from the railroad track You can get anything you want, at Alice's Restaurant Da-da da-da da-da da-dum At Alice's Restaurant ",1967

Mago," Una Noche más en la ciudad, de fondo queda el ruido de algún bar grumete a la deriva en un tapón de soledad, que quema el aire y mas. Surcando las calles sin rumbo fijo entraste en mal lugar cargado el ambiente, miradas oscuras, no puedes respirar, solo dos ojos desde la barra te invitan a sonar sientes en tu rostro algo parecido a la brisa del mar. Y ves venir un cuerpo de mujer hacia ti Y empieza a brillar la luz de tu corazon mientras unos labios se apoderan lentamente de ti y una ventana a ninguna parte se ha comenzado a abrir.

Y nunca tuve el coraje suficiente Pa' decir yo voy a me quedo Mejor desde cero Que decir desde nunca ¿Y cómo darte el cielo Si nunca pisé la luna? ¿Y cómo soy sincero si nadie me pregunta? Si me ves separado es porque todo se me junta Sí no entré la razón antes de entrar en tí Lo tenía todo pa' no ser feliz Y nunca me dio por vivir la vida pero sí fingía Porque sonreí cuándo dijé yo puedo en vez de por fin Cambié el hazer por el hacer por mí Rompí el camino pa' poder seguir Mejor desde cero Que decir desde nunca ¿Y cómo darte el cielo Si nunca pisé la luna? ¿Y cómo soy sincero si nadie me pregunta? Si me ves separado es porque todo se me junta ",1920

Tempo Ruim," Eu sou o Deus da Guerra, no meu peito rufam tambores Tocados em ritos, criados sobre o grito de dores Angústia do porão, desejo de vingança, solidão Piedade, hoje não, talvez quando eu tinha um coração A meta: Construir outros quinhentos E tô disposto a morrer, igual cada um dos trezentos Espartanos, o que vocês são?

Polka Dots And Moonbeams," A country dance was being held in a garden I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon"" Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams All around a pug-nosed dream The music started and was I the perplexed one I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?"" In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream There were questions in the eyes of other dancers As we floated over the floor There were questions but my heart knew all the answers And perhaps a few things more Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after"" And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams When I kiss the pug-nosed dream ",1947

Sono Filippo Argenti Il vicino di casa che nella Commedia ponesti tra questi violenti Sono quello che annega nel fango, pestato dai demoni intorno Cos'è vuoi provocarmi, sommo? Puoi solo provocarmi sonno! Alighieri, vedi, tremi, mi temi come gli eritemi, eri te che mi deridevi Devi combattere Ma te la dai a gambe levate, ma quale vate? Vattene! Ehi, quando quando vuoi, dimmi dimmi dove! Sono dannato ma te le do di santa ragione! Così impari a rimare male di me Io non ti maledirei, ti farei male Alighieri Non sei divino, individuo, se t’individuo, ti divido!

Per annichilire ogni ghibellino, Cerchio 7, giro primo! Fatti non foste per vivere come bruti, ben detta Ma sputi vendetta dalla barchetta di Flegias Complimenti per la regia Argenti vive, vive, vivrà, alla gente piace la mia ferocità, persino tu che mi anneghi a furia di calci sui denti, ti chiami Dante Alighieri, ma somigli negli atteggiamenti, a Filippo Argenti Poeta tu mostri lo sdegno a Filippo Argenti Ma tutti consacrano questo regno a Filippo Argenti Le tue terzine sono carta straccia Le mie cinquine sulla tua faccia lasciano il segno Poeta tu mostri lo sdegno a Filippo Argenti Ma tutti consacrano questo regno a Filippo Argenti Le tue terzine sono carta straccia Le mie cinquine sulla tua faccia lasciano il segno Stai lontano dalle fiamme, perché ti bruci Guardati le spalle, caro Dante, è pieno di Bruti Tutti i grandi oratori sono stati fatti fuori Da signori, violenti e nerboruti Anche gli alberi sgomitano per un po’ di sole Il resto sono solo inutili belle parole Sono sicuro che in futuro le giovani menti Saranno come l’Argenti e l’arte porterà il mio nome Filippo Argenti!

Mother Goose Songs, As I did walk by Hampstead Fair I came upon Mother Goose - so I turned her loose She was screaming And a foreign student said to me Was it really true there are elephants and lions too In Piccadilly Circus? Walked down by the bathing pond To try and catch some sun Saw at least a hundred schoolgirls sobbing Into handkerchiefs as one I don't believe they knew I was a schoolboy And a bearded lady said to me If you start your raving and your misbehaving You'll be sorry Then the chicken-fancier came to play With his long red beard (and his sister's weird: She drives a lorry) Laughed down by the putting green I popped 'em in their holes Four and twenty labourers were labouring Digging up their gold I don't believe they knew That I was Long John Silver Saw Johnny Scarecrow make his rounds In his jet-black mac (which he won't give back) Stole it from a snowman ,1949
'Twas the Night Before Christmas," Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads. And Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap. When out on the roof there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave the lustre of midday to objects below, when, what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer. With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name: ""Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"" As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky so up to the house-top the coursers they flew, with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes--how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow. The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath. He had a broad face and a little round belly, that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk. And laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose. He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"" ",1949

If We Must Die," Killing us one by one In one way or another America will find a way to eliminate the problem One by one The problem is the troublesome black youth of the ghetto's And one by one We are being wiped off the face of this earth At an extremely alarming rate And even more alarming is the fact That we are not fighting back Brothers, sisters, niggas When I say ""nigga"" it is not the nigga we have grown to fear It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning But to me it means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, nigga Niggas, what are we going to do? Walk blind into a line or fight Fight and die if we must die, like niggas This is for the masses, the lower classes The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living But we were kept out Made to feel inferior, but we're superior Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us Honour a man that refuses to respect us Emancipation Proclamation? Please! Lincoln just said that to save the nation These are lies that we all accepted Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it Running through our community, killing the unity The war on drugs is a war on you and me And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin' But it's wrong to keep someone from learning something So get up, it's time to start nation building I'm fed up, we gotta start teach the children That they can be all that they want to be There's much more to life than just poverty This is definitely uh... words of wisdom AMERICA! AMERICA! AMERIK-K-KA I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault For suppressing and punishing my people I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me Trapped in the projects And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence? Words of Wisdom Based upon the strength of a nation Conquer the enemy armed with education Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do Know thyself, teach by what we've been through Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been No one will ever oppress this race again No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that? 'Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week? He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime But forget it, cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe 'Cause it will strangle ya Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain Beg as you can obtain from which you came Swear that your mother is living in equality Forgetting your brother that's living in poverty Thought they had us beaten when they took out King But the battle ain't over till the black man sings Words of Wisdom The battle ain't over 'till the black man sings Words of Wisdom NIGHTMARE! That's what I am America's nightmare I am what you made me The hate and the evil that you gave me I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people For Four hundred plus years You should be scared You should be running You should be trying to silence me Ha, but you cannot escape fate For it is my turn to come Just as you rose you will fall By my hands America, you reap what you sow 2Pacalypse, America's Nightmare Ice Cube and Da Lynch Mob, America's Nightmare Above The Law, America's Nightmare Paris, America's Nightmare Public Enemy, America's Nightmare KRS-One, America's Nightmare New Afrikan Panthers, America's nightmare Mutulu Shakur, America's Nightmare Geronimo Pratt, America's Nightmare Assata Shakur, America's Nightmare ",1954

Man Piaba," When I was a lad of three-foot-three Certain questions occurred to me, So I asked me father quite seriously To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee. He stammered and he stuttered pathetically And this is what he said to me. He said, ""The woman piaba and the man piaba and the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass, The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm, And the famous grandy scratch scratch. It was clear as mud but it covered the ground And the confusion made the brain go 'round. I went and ask a good friend of mine, Known to the world as Albert Einstein. He said ""Son, from the beginning of time and creativity There existed the force of relativity Pi r square and a minus ten means a routine only when The solar system in one light year Make the Hayden planetarium disappear So if Mt Everest doesn't move I am positive that it will prove That the woman piaba and the man piaba And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass, The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm, And the famous grandy scratch scratch. It was clear as mud but it covered the ground And the confusion made the brain go 'round. I grabbed a boat and went abroad In Baden Baden asked Sigmund Freud He said ""Son, from your sad face remove the grouch Put the body down up on the couch I can see from your frustration a neurotic sublimation Hey love and hate is psychosomatic Your Rorsach shows that you're a peri pathetic It all started with a broken sibling In the words of the famous Rudyard Kipling That the woman piaba and the man piaba And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass, The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm, And the famous grandy scratch scratch.
