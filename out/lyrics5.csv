Tea For Two," I'm discontented with homes that I've rented So I have invented my own. Darling, this place is lovely oasis Where life's weary taste is unknown Far from the crowded city Where flowers pretty caress the stream Cozy to hide in, to live side by side in, Don't let it apart in my dream Picture me upon your knee Just tea for two And two for tea Just me for you And you for me alone Nobody near us to see us or hear us No friends or relations On weekend vacations We won't have it known That we own a telephone, dear Day will break and I'll wake And start to bake a sugar cake For you to take for all the boys to see We will raise a family A boy for you And a girl for me Can't you see how happy we would be Picture you upon my knee Just tea for two And two for tea Just me for you And you for me alone Nobody near us to see us or hear us No friends or relations On weekend vacations We won't have it known That we own a telephone, dear Day will break, you'll wake And start to bake a sugar cake For you to take for all the boys to see We will raise a family A boy for you And a girl for me Can't you see how happy we would be ",1947

Polka Dots And Moonbeams," A country dance was being held in a garden I felt a bump and heard an ""Oh, beg your pardon"" Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams All around a pug-nosed dream The music started and was I the perplexed one I held my breath and said ""May I have the next one?"" In my frightened arms, polka dots and moonbeams Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream There were questions in the eyes of other dancers As we floated over the floor There were questions but my heart knew all the answers And perhaps a few things more Now in a cottage built of lilacs and laughter I know the meaning of the words ""Ever after"" And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams When I kiss the pug-nosed dream ",1947
Closing Remarks," If you're freezing on your left side And you're boiling on your right side Then I guess you might be warm upon the line There are many ways one can divide a life And I've got mine I was flying home and I Saw the sunset from the sky I saw the dark come spooning down upon the land And I thought about the distance we all cover And it made me sad And as the old year took a bow And joined the setting sun It comes around again Like a refrain And we all sing along And think of things we should've done Till one year when the new year never came Little comfort, little comfort I'm afraid you're not enough I've had some learning both unwelcome and unkind And it seems there's but one story told And then re-worked all throughout time Are you a good one or a cruel one It is just the laws that make us bad What can we do to measure where we stand Well, I judge myself by what I give to someone else So I'll know where I am Don't let that sense of urgency betray you in the dark The rustle of a curtain's not a sign Don't frame this picture now As some kind of closing remark And most of all stay warm upon the line Most of all stay warm upon the line It's best if you stay warm upon the line ",1947

Les jeunes filles," There's a little sting in my heart That no one can see There’s no use yanking hard On its rusty seems And this little thorn in my heart Bitterly defined Has a taste has a smell Envenoms my dreams Cause baby that's you - Quand tu vis In the middle of me - Dans ma voix We're never getting better better, yet - T’as plus peur And baby that's you - Tu me suis And I want you to feel - Et tu vois We're never getting better better - Le meilleur, le meilleur J’suis une petite voix dans ton coeur Que personne ne peut voir Une voix dans ta tête Qui ne s’arrête jamais J’suis une petite voix dans ton coeur Qui ne peut plus sortir Une chose merveilleuse Que personne ne peut croire Cause baby that's you - Quand tu vis In the middle of me - Dans ma voix We're never getting better better, yet - T’as plus peur And baby that's you - Tu me suis And I want you to feel - Et tu vois We're never getting better better - Le meilleur, le meilleur Cause baby that's you - Quand tu vois Give a sign you feel - Dans mes yeux We're never getting better better, yet - T’as plus peur Darling don't undo - Tu t’oublies The spell and pursue - Si tu vis The trail to getting better - Le monde tel que je suis Tu me baiseras des baisers de ta bouche Nothing's worth your poison, nothing matches this pain Mon amour t’entraînera plus haut si tu me touches Get drunk on your juice, last psychotic game Tes odeurs, mes huiles, ta beauté ruisselante Nothing's worth your poison, nothing matches this pain Les jeunes filles en frémissent et toi de mort lente ",1948
"""Paludes"""," ""Mentre solcavamo l'immobile palude Mi si parò davanti uno spirito coperto di fango Allungò verso la barca entrambe le mani ma Virgilio pronto lo respinse Dicendogli, ""Via di qui, vattene a stare con gli altri maledetti!"" Ed io :"" Maestro sarei molto, molto desideroso, prima di uscire dalla palude, di vederlo immergere in questa melma"" Poco dopo vidi gli iracondi fare di lui un tale scempio Che per esso ancora glorifico e rendo grazie a Dio"" Tutti insieme gridavano: A Filippo Argenti A Filippo Argenti"" Ciao Dante, ti ricordi di me? Sono Filippo Argenti Il vicino di casa che nella Commedia ponesti tra questi violenti Sono quello che annega nel fango, pestato dai demoni intorno Cos'è vuoi provocarmi, sommo? Puoi solo provocarmi sonno! Alighieri, vedi, tremi, mi temi come gli eritemi, eri te che mi deridevi Devi combattere Ma te la dai a gambe levate, ma quale vate? Vattene! Ehi, quando quando vuoi, dimmi dimmi dove! Sono dannato ma te le do di santa ragione! Così impari a rimare male di me Io non ti maledirei, ti farei male Alighieri Non sei divino, individuo, se t’individuo, ti divido! Inutile che decanti l’amante, Dante, provochi solo cali di libido Il mondo non è dei poeti, il mondo è di noi prepotenti Vai rimando alla genti che mi getti nel fango, ma io rimango l’Argenti! Argenti vive, vive e vivrà, sono ancora il più temuto della città Sono ancora il più rispettato, quindi cosa t’inventi? Se questo mondo è l’Inferno allora sappi che appartiene a Filippo Argenti Poeta tu mostri lo sdegno a Filippo Argenti Ma tutti consacrano questo regno a Filippo Argenti Le tue terzine sono carta straccia Le mie cinquine sulla tua faccia lasciano il segno Poeta tu mostri lo sdegno a Filippo Argenti Ma tutti consacrano questo regno a Filippo Argenti Le tue terzine sono carta straccia Le mie cinquine sulla tua faccia lasciano il segno Non è vero che la lingua ferisce più della spada, è una cazzata Cosa pensi che tenga più a bada, rima baciata o mazza chiodata? Non c’è dittatore che abdichi perché persuaso Pare che nessuno sappia nemmeno che significhi ""abdicare"", ma di che parliamo? Attaccare me non ti redime (no!), eri tu che davi direttive (no!) Per annichilire ogni ghibellino, Cerchio 7, giro primo! Fatti non foste per vivere come bruti, ben detta Ma sputi vendetta dalla barchetta di Flegias Complimenti per la regia Argenti vive, vive, vivrà, alla gente piace la mia ferocità, persino tu che mi anneghi a furia di calci sui denti, ti chiami Dante Alighieri, ma somigli negli atteggiamenti, a Filippo Argenti Poeta tu mostri lo sdegno a Filippo Argenti Ma tutti consacrano questo regno a Filippo Argenti Le tue terzine sono carta straccia Le mie cinquine sulla tua faccia lasciano il segno Poeta tu mostri lo sdegno a Filippo Argenti Ma tutti consacrano questo regno a Filippo Argenti Le tue terzine sono carta straccia Le mie cinquine sulla tua faccia lasciano il segno Stai lontano dalle fiamme, perché ti bruci Guardati le spalle, caro Dante, è pieno di Bruti Tutti i grandi oratori sono stati fatti fuori Da signori, violenti e nerboruti Anche gli alberi sgomitano per un po’ di sole Il resto sono solo inutili belle parole Sono sicuro che in futuro le giovani menti Saranno come l’Argenti e l’arte porterà il mio nome Filippo Argenti! Filippo Argenti! Filippo Argenti! Filippo Argenti! ""Lo lasciammo là, nella palude, non vi racconto altro."" ",1949

Mother Goose Songs, As I did walk by Hampstead Fair I came upon Mother Goose - so I turned her loose She was screaming And a foreign student said to me Was it really true there are elephants and lions too In Piccadilly Circus? Walked down by the bathing pond To try and catch some sun Saw at least a hundred schoolgirls sobbing Into handkerchiefs as one I don't believe they knew I was a schoolboy And a bearded lady said to me If you start your raving and your misbehaving You'll be sorry Then the chicken-fancier came to play With his long red beard (and his sister's weird: She drives a lorry) Laughed down by the putting green I popped 'em in their holes Four and twenty labourers were labouring Digging up their gold I don't believe they knew That I was Long John Silver Saw Johnny Scarecrow make his rounds In his jet-black mac (which he won't give back) Stole it from a snowman ,1949
'Twas the Night Before Christmas," Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugar plums danced in their heads. And Mama in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap, had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap. When out on the roof there arose such a clatter, I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window I flew like a flash, tore open the shutter, and threw up the sash. The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow gave the lustre of midday to objects below, when, what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer. With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name: ""Now Dasher! Now Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen! On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen! To the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!"" As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky so up to the house-top the coursers they flew, with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too. And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoof. As I drew in my head and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, and his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot. A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, and he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. His eyes--how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry! His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard on his chin was as white as the snow. The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, and the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath. He had a broad face and a little round belly, that shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, and filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk. And laying his finger aside of his nose, and giving a nod, up the chimney he rose. He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, And away they all flew like the down of a thistle. But I heard him exclaim, 'ere he drove out of sight, ""Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!"" ",1949
