Rain or Hail," We're late to bed We're early to rise Wipe the sleep from our eyes We head to work We catch a lift We have a smoke and we start the shift We open up We start to wake Maybe it's gonna be our day And suddenly We start to smile The sun is up for a while And you may see this place and find no worth But it's our little piece of heaven here on Earth Yeah, we always have a good time Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine Yeah, we're all living the good life Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine We reach the top We took the fall But we laughed through it all 'Cause dreaming of them better days Has always been our way And you may see my friends and find no worth But, no, I'll never go and change them for the world Yeah, we always have a good time Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine Yeah, we're all living the good life Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine Come on Yeah, we always have a good time Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine Always have a good time Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine Yeah, we're all living the good life Whether it's hail rain or in sunshine ",1950
