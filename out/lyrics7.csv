The Ritual," A new age, A new golden age is upon us The sun shines on obsidian, this blade will plunge into a holy reverie Upon the altar lies the one who's worthy, we'll pluck his heart from his chest cavity (Time to die) Between the peaks that rise, his chalice fills with rivers of sacrifice And when the time is come, his drink will spill onto the steps of the sun Now go and be the heart that saves what we've undone This is worth death Now be the heart that saves what can't be saved Worthless Fire is lit within the gaping wound, we'll light our torches from his rife brazier The hearth in every temple cold, suspended, make known the time of empty days is here Years crawl faster as the hands tick closer to the twelve One more until it's over Years crawl faster as the hands tick closer to the twelve One more until the final five And if the ribs should not bring forth new fire Will our God fall from the sky? Be strong, tonight there is no room for failure The light must come and drive the dark away Destroy mankind We'll stand and harken in this solar era The skies will fill with cries of victory Improve design Thirteen Reed Twenty Ahau Transcending into another time ",1951

Mending Wall, Me and my old man Don't see eye to eye We take our walks outside Underneath the birch trees He said I think it's gonna freeze this year I said I gotta get away from here Me and my old man Me and my old man Should have been enough to know That you'd let us all down Could have been enough to try Without making a sound It's all part of the plan my dear It's all part of the plan my dear So we walked along the mending walls Laid beneath the tortured talls And we sang a song of newfound cheer Laughed at the passing years Yeah we talked about things to come Talked about the battles won He said I think it's gonna freeze this year I said I gotta get away from here Should have been enough to know That you'd let us all down Could have been enough to try Could have been enough to try Oh I've been such a fool Spent my life waiting for you Through these trees I see With my father's eyes I realize the weight Should have been enough to know That you'd let us all down Could have been enough to try Without making a sound It's all part of the plan my dear It's all part of the plan my dear It's all part of the plan my dear Between me and my old man Gotta get away from here Gotta get away from here ,1951

Paul Revere," Now here's a little story I've got to tell About three bad brothers you know so well It started way back in history With Adrock, M.C.A., and me - Mike D. Been had a little horsy named Paul Revere Just me and my horsy and a quart of beer Riding across the land, kicking up sand Sheriff's posse on my tail cause I'm in demand One lonely Beastie I be All by myself without nobody The sun is beating down on my baseball hat The air is gettin' hot the beer is getting flat Lookin' for a girl I ran into a guy His name is M.C.A., I said, ""Howdy"" he said, ""Hi"" He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst The brew was in my hand and he was on my tip His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry he asked me for a sip He said, ""Can I get some?"" I said, ""You can't get none!"" Had a chance to run He pulled out his shotgun He was quick on the draw I thought I'd be dead He put the gun to my head and this is what he said, ""Now my name is M.C.A. I've got a license to kill I think you know what time it is it's time to get ill Now what do we have here an outlaw and his beer I run this land, you understand I make myself clear."" We stepped into the wind he had a gun, I had a grin You think this story's over but it's ready to begin ""Now I got the gun you got the brew You got two choices of what you can do It's not a tough decision as you can see I can blow you away or you can ride with me"" I said, I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter I did it like this, I did it like that I did it with a whiffleball bat So I'm on the run the cop's got my gun And right about now it's time to have some fun The King Adrock that is my name And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne."" We rode for six hours then we hit the spot The beat was a bumping and the girlies was hot This dude was staring like he knows who we are We took the empty spot next to him at the bar M.C.A. said, ""Yo, you know this kid?"" I said, ""I didn't."" but I know he did The kid said, ""Get ready cause this ain't funny My name's Mike D. and I'm about to get money."" Pulled out the jammy aimed it at the sky He yelled, ""Stick 'em up!"" and let two fly Hands went up and people hit the floor He wasted two kids that ran for the door ""I'm Mike D. and I get respect Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect"" M.C.A. was with it and he's my ace So I grabbed the piano player and I punched him in the face The piano player's out the music stopped His boy had beef and he got dropped Mike D. grabbed the money M.C.A. snatched the gold I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.

Throw Mountains, Too many times in the past I tried to climb the mountain But the inner voices laughed Too many blocks in the road I tried to find a new way But there's nowhere else to go But now I silence the crowd And nothing can stand in my way Throwing mountains to the sky And the shadows reveal the horizon Driving oceans to the side And my footprints will cross the divide New pressures weighing me down I want to take the first step But I'm tethered to the doubt Too many forces collide This requires something bigger Than confidence and pride I won't hold back anymore Nothing can stand in my way Throwing mountains to the sky And the shadows reveal the horizon Driving oceans to the side And my footprints will cross the divide Too many times in the past I ran toward the ocean And I was frozen in my tracks So many times on the path I felt the power coursing But the lighting didn't last But now the moment is here Nothing can stand in my way Throwing mountains to the sky And the shadows reveal the horizon Driving oceans to the side And my footprints will cross the divide Throwing mountains to the sky And the shadows reveal the horizon Driving oceans to the side And my footprints will cross the divide ,1951

"Little Joe, The Wrangler", Little Joe the Wrangler will wrangle nevermore His days with the roundup they are o'er Was a year ago last April when he rode into our camp Just a little Texas stray and nothing more Was late in the evening when he rode into our camp On the little Texas pony he called Chaw With his brogan shoes and overalls a tougher looking kid You never in your life before had saw His saddle was a Texas kack built many years ago An OK spur on one foot lightly swung With his packroll in a cotton sack so loosely tied behind And a canteen from his saddle horn was slung He said he had to leave his home his pa had married twice His new ma whipped him every day or two So he saddled up old Chaw one night and lit a shuck his way He said he'd try to paddle his own canoe He said if we would give him work he'd do the best he could Though he didn't know straight up about a cow So the boss he cut him out a mount and kindly put him on He sorta liked this little kid somehow He learned to wrangle horses and learned to know them all And get them in at daybreakk if he could And to trail the old chuck wagon and always hitch the team And help to cook each evening rustle wood We had hardly reached the Pecos the weather it was fine We were camped down on the south side in a draw When a northern commenced blowing and we doubled up our guards It took every one of us to hold them in Little Joe the Wrangler was called out with the rest Scarcely had the little fellow reached the herd When the cattle they stampeded like a hailstorm on they fled And everyone was ridin' for the lead Amid the streaks of lightnin' there was one horse up ahead He was tryin' to check the leaders in their speed It was little Joe the Wrangler with a slicker o'er his head He was ridin' Old Blue Rocket in the lead At last we got them millin' and kinda quited down And the extra guards back to the wagon went But there was one a missin' we could see it at a glance Was our little Texas stray poor Wrangler Joe Next morning just at daybreak we found where Rocket fell Down in a washout twenty feet below Beneath his horse his life had gone his spung had run its knell Was our little Texas stray poor Wrangler Joe ,1952
Top Banana," In my time I've been a few places, And I've many a story to tell. Here I am still as strong As I've been all along, I'm not ready for heaven or hell.

If We Must Die," Killing us one by one In one way or another America will find a way to eliminate the problem One by one The problem is the troublesome black youth of the ghetto's And one by one We are being wiped off the face of this earth At an extremely alarming rate And even more alarming is the fact That we are not fighting back Brothers, sisters, niggas When I say ""nigga"" it is not the nigga we have grown to fear It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning But to me it means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, nigga Niggas, what are we going to do? Walk blind into a line or fight Fight and die if we must die, like niggas This is for the masses, the lower classes The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living But we were kept out Made to feel inferior, but we're superior Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us Honour a man that refuses to respect us Emancipation Proclamation? Please! Lincoln just said that to save the nation These are lies that we all accepted Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it Running through our community, killing the unity The war on drugs is a war on you and me And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me And Lady Liberty? Stupid bitch lied to me This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin' But it's wrong to keep someone from learning something So get up, it's time to start nation building I'm fed up, we gotta start teach the children That they can be all that they want to be There's much more to life than just poverty This is definitely uh... words of wisdom AMERICA! AMERICA! AMERIK-K-KA I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault For suppressing and punishing my people I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me Trapped in the projects And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence? Words of Wisdom Based upon the strength of a nation Conquer the enemy armed with education Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do Know thyself, teach by what we've been through Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been No one will ever oppress this race again No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that? 'Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week? He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime But forget it, cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe 'Cause it will strangle ya Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain Beg as you can obtain from which you came Swear that your mother is living in equality Forgetting your brother that's living in poverty Thought they had us beaten when they took out King But the battle ain't over till the black man sings Words of Wisdom The battle ain't over 'till the black man sings Words of Wisdom NIGHTMARE! That's what I am America's nightmare I am what you made me The hate and the evil that you gave me I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people For Four hundred plus years You should be scared You should be running You should be trying to silence me Ha, but you cannot escape fate For it is my turn to come Just as you rose you will fall By my hands America, you reap what you sow 2Pacalypse, America's Nightmare Ice Cube and Da Lynch Mob, America's Nightmare Above The Law, America's Nightmare Paris, America's Nightmare Public Enemy, America's Nightmare KRS-One, America's Nightmare New Afrikan Panthers, America's nightmare Mutulu Shakur, America's Nightmare Geronimo Pratt, America's Nightmare Assata Shakur, America's Nightmare ",1954

Man Piaba," When I was a lad of three-foot-three Certain questions occurred to me, So I asked me father quite seriously To tell me the story 'bout the bird and bee.

He said ""Son, from the beginning of time and creativity There existed the force of relativity Pi r square and a minus ten means a routine only when The solar system in one light year Make the Hayden planetarium disappear So if Mt Everest doesn't move I am positive that it will prove That the woman piaba and the man piaba And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass, The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm, And the famous grandy scratch scratch. It was clear as mud but it covered the ground And the confusion made the brain go 'round. I grabbed a boat and went abroad In Baden Baden asked Sigmund Freud He said ""Son, from your sad face remove the grouch Put the body down up on the couch I can see from your frustration a neurotic sublimation Hey love and hate is psychosomatic Your Rorsach shows that you're a peri pathetic It all started with a broken sibling In the words of the famous Rudyard Kipling That the woman piaba and the man piaba And the Ton Ton call baka lemon grass, The lily root, gully root, belly root uhmm, And the famous grandy scratch scratch.
